# Tillicum Slurm Tutorial

## Overview

High-performance computing (HPC) clusters like **Tillicum** use a **job scheduler** to manage and optimize the allocation of compute resources. A scheduler coordinates how and when jobs are executed across available CPUs, GPUs, memory, and nodes, ensuring efficient and fair use of the system.

**Slurm** (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management): the job scheduler used across Hyak clusters, including Tillicum. It handles job submission, resource allocation, and queueing, enabling thousands of users to share the cluster efficiently. For detailed reference, visit the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).

Tillicum is a **GPU-only** cluster designed for compute- and AI-intensive workloads. All jobs must request at least one GPU using the `--gpus` option in Slurm.

ðŸŽ¯ **By completing this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:**
- Submit and run interactive and batch jobs with Slurm
- Understand QOS (Quality of Service) and resource billing on Tillicum
- Monitor job status and resource usage
- Write Bash scripts to set up your workflows
- Launch array jobs for parallel workloads
